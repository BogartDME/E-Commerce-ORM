## About the Project

  Hi, my name is Edwin Pietrowski, thank you for your interest in my project!

  This app is the backend for an e-commerce website. It allows the user to manage the store's stock in an easy quick way. It allows the user to add, update, delete, and search through all stock, or search one item. This will aid the user in staying competitive with other e-commerce sites and expedites the ability to grow.
